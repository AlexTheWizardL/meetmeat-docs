# Mobile App Research

Research project comparing React Native vs Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.

## Research Document

**[Read the full research here](./RESEARCH.md)** - Comprehensive 2024-2025 comparison covering:

- Architecture deep dive (JSI, Fabric, TurboModules vs Impeller, Skia)
- Performance benchmarks (CPU, Memory, FPS)
- Build & deployment processes
- Debugging experience comparison
- Market demand & salary data
- Companies using each framework
- Developer pain points

## Quick Summary

| Aspect | React Native | Flutter |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Language | JavaScript/TypeScript | Dart |
| Performance | Good (New Architecture) | Excellent |
| Job Market | More jobs (5-6x) | Higher salaries (7-20%) |
| Learning Curve | Easier for JS devs | Easier for complete beginners |
| Best For | JS teams, web code sharing | Performance, UI consistency |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Try sample projects in both frameworks
- [ ] Build a small app to compare hands-on experience
- [ ] Make final technology decision
